	<h2>That's super mean!</h2>
	
	<p>That's not really a question, is it?</p>
	
	<p>More seriously, this page is meant to be light-hearted. The Go developers
		know that generic types and functions are a oft-requested feature,
		and they have been working very hard on producing a design that works
		and that will stand the test of time, together with the community.
		I am convinced that the end result will be great.</p>
	
	<h2>What are Generics and why are they hard?</h2>
	
	<p>See <a href="https://blog.golang.org/why-generics"><i>Why Generics?</i></a>
		(by Ian Lance Taylor from the Go team) for an introduction, including
		code examples.</p>
	
	<p>The reason generics are hard is that they are a feature that can destroy
		a language if done wrong. A bad implementation may fracture the community
		and destroy the simplicity and ease of use we have been enjoying. Compile
		times or binary sizes might increase to the point of being a nuisance.</p>
	
	<p>That's why it is vital to come up with a design in the original spirit
		of Go. This is a much more difficult task than just copying what has been
		done in Java or other languages. As an example, the first iterations of
		the design included "type contracts", whose syntax was widely criticized.
		The syntax has gone through multiple variants, and there is an ongoing
		experiment to see if the concepts of interfaces and type
		contracts can be unified.</p>
	
	<h2>Who made this?</h2>
	
	<p>My name is Benny Siegert (aka
		<a href="https://twitter.com/bentsukun">@bentsukun</a>).
		I also have a blog, at <a href="https://bentsukun.ch/">bentsukun.ch</a>.</p>
